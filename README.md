# Curriculum Vitae Compiler

## Description

Embarking on my first React project, I am developing a web application that allows users to effortlessly create and manage their CVs. The user-friendly interface features dynamic forms for inputting personal details. Users can easily edit or delete information based on their preferences, providing flexibility and control. The goal is to deliver a seamless and visually appealing experience, empowering users to craft and refine their professional profiles with ease.

## Struggle points

Initially, I struggled with understanding how to use a single function to handle each component of the application and effectively target them using IDs and values (refer to line 33 in App.jsx). Subsequently, my primary challenge, which was also the main goal of the project, was figuring out how to use props and lift state to facilitate communication between different components. While my code works, it feels somewhat repetitive. The same goes for states; I grasped their general structure and purpose, but at times, I found myself getting lost in the React DOM tree among various components. I believe the project has been executed correctly, but there's certainly room for further optimization.

## Conclusion


This project has been enjoyable for me as it provided a preliminary glimpse into the capabilities of React. I am pleased with the overall validity and functionality of my project. Additionally, I incorporated a couple of extra features – printing and downloading the CV – which allowed me to delve into print media queries and document download functions. This involved installing packages such as html2canvas and jspdf, broadening my understanding of additional tools and functionalities within the React ecosystem.
